# maven-exercises

The goal for this exercise is to get familiar with Maven, adding dependencies to your project, and using those dependencies.

1. Create a new Maven project named maven-exercises.

2. Add the Apache Commons Lang library to your project.
   
   * This is a utility library for many different things; we will use it specifically for String manipulations, which is available through the StringUtils class.

3. Create a new class with a main method that prompts the user for input and does the following (using the Stringutils class)

    * Tells whether or not what the user entered is a number
    * Flips the case of the string
    * Reverses the string
